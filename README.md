# MercenaryJukebox
Adapted and translated assignment for the programming 2 course.

This assignment simulates the workings of a jukebox with monetary priority. When you make a request you also pay a certain amount, and the higher the amount the bigger the priority your song will have. This was an assignment used to test our knowledge from the programming 1 course, which is mainly different types of lists and how to use them.
